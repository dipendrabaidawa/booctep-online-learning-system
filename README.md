Hello there,
I'm glad to notice you about the workflow on this repository.

# Create your branch
$ git checkout -b
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "comment here"
$ git push -u origin

before merging to main branch, you need to create pull request on your branch.

will check your updates and merge them on my side

deploy the final version to heroku.

don't push the assets like video and images because heroku max size is under 500 MB.

HAPPY CODDING! BEST OF LUCK!
